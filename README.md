<h1>Purpose</h1>
<h3>This project was created to help individuals keep track of their health and goals through exercise. It is a simple app which gives basic output and allows the user to track their progress through an easier method.</h3>
<h1>Participants</h1>
<h3>Gurinderpreet Singh</h3>
<h3>Contribution is welcome after proper contact.</h3>
<h1>Challenges</h1>
<h3>This app is one of the first React apps I have developed on my own. This in itself was a big challenge, although my previous projects made it easier to adapt and learn.</h3>
<h3>The main challenge in this project was learning organization skills. How you import, which files you create, and proper naming seem like simple practices, but they can quickly become major obstacles if not kept in proper order.</h3>
<h1>Future Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>I would like to create more customizations to allow the user to personalize the app.</li>
<li>Increasing the amount of exercises available.</li>
<li>Allowing different diets or health levels to contribute to more accurate output.</li>
</ul>
